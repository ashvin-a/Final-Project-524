        "Two plants share a common logistics network that includes ports, carriers, warehouses, shops, and products. Both plants manufacture the same type of product, but their production methods differ, resulting in varying production costs. However, because the market is competitive, both plants must sell their products at the same price. Since one plant uses a cheaper production method, it carries a higher risk of defects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, each warehouse connected to a shop must contain at least 140% of the quantity of good (non-defective) products available in that shop. Also, the earlier plants introduce their product to the market, the more customers have the opportunity to see it, and it is more likely to be purchased by them. If a plant uses a carrier that has faster delivery, it can get its products to the market soon, which in turn comes with a cost. Each warehouse also has a storage cost, but the warehouse does not accept any defective products for storage because of safety regulations. The main objective is to determine the optimal logistics path for each plant that maximizes overall profit."
